1. bcryptjs: Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power.
2. body-parser: Node.js body parsing middleware.
Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
4. concurrently: Run multiple commands concurrently. Like npm run watch-js & npm run watch-less but better.
5. express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
6. gravatar: A library to generate Gravatar URLs in Node.js Based on gravatar specs.
7. jsonwebtoken: An implementation of JSON Web Tokens.
8. mongoose: Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
9. passport: Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.
Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.
10. passport-jwt: A Passport strategy for authenticating with a JSON Web Token.
This module lets you authenticate endpoints using a JSON web token. It is intended to be used to secure RESTful endpoints without sessions.
11. validator: A library of string validators and sanitizers.
